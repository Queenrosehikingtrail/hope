                    <p>This guide provides essential information to help you stay safe while hiking the Queen Rose Trail. Please familiarize yourself with this information before starting your hike.</p>

                    <h3>Wildlife Encounters</h3>
                    <p>Encountering wildlife is a part of the hiking experience. By taking precautions and knowing how to react, you can minimize risks.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>General Safety Around Wildlife:</strong></p>
                    <p>Always maintain a respectful distance from all animals.</p>
                    <p>Never feed wildlife. This can make them dependent on humans and may lead to aggressive behavior.</p>
                    <p>Do not try to touch or provoke any animal.</p>
                    <p>Be aware of your surroundings and listen for sounds that might indicate animals are nearby.</p>
                    <p>Store all food securely to prevent attracting animals.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Snakes:</strong></p>
                    <p>Mpumalanga is home to various snake species. While most are not dangerous, it's important to be cautious.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>Stay strictly on marked trails.</p>
                    <p>Wear sturdy closed hiking boots and long pants.</p>
                    <p>Watch carefully where you step and where you place your hands, especially when moving over rocks or logs.</p>
                    <p>Avoid walking through thick grass or dense undergrowth whenever possible.</p>
                    <p>If staying overnight in tents, keep them zipped up and check your shoes and gear before use.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>During an Encounter:</strong></p>
                    <p>If you see a snake, stop and remain calm. Snakes usually only bite if they feel threatened or are surprised.</p>
                    <p>Slowly back away from the snake, giving it plenty of space to move away. Snakes do not chase people.</p>
                    <p>Do not attempt to handle, corner, or kill the snake.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>If Bitten:</strong></p>
                    <p>Stay calm. Panicking can make symptoms worse.</p>
                    <p>Seek immediate medical attention. Contact the emergency number for the trail or local authorities without delay.</p>
                    <p>Keep the bitten limb as still as possible, ideally below the level of the heart.</p>
                    <p>Remove any tight jewelry or clothing near the bite area before swelling begins.</p>
                    <p>Do NOT cut the wound or attempt to suck out the venom.</p>
                    <p>Do NOT apply a tourniquet.</p>
                    <p>Do NOT apply ice or heat to the bite.</p>
                    <p>Try to remember the appearance of the snake (size, color, pattern, head shape) to help with identification and treatment.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="emergency-card">
                    <h3>Weather Safety</h3>
                    <p><strong>Lightning:</strong></p>
                    <p>Mpumalanga experiences frequent thunderstorms, especially in summer.</p>
                    <p>If caught in a thunderstorm:</p>
                    <p>Avoid open areas, hilltops, and isolated tall trees.</p>
                    <p>Stay away from water bodies and metal objects.</p>
                    <p>If in a group, spread out to reduce multiple casualties.</p>
                    <p>The "lightning position" is a last resort: squat on the balls of your feet with your feet together, head tucked, and ears covered. Only touch the ground with your feet.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Extreme Heat:</strong></p>
                    <p>Hike during cooler parts of the day (early morning, late afternoon).</p>
                    <p>Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat.</p>
                    <p>Apply sunscreen regularly (SPF 30+).</p>
                    <p>Carry and drink plenty of water (minimum 2-3 liters per person for a day hike).</p>
                    <p>Know the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke (see First Aid Guide).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Rain and Flooding:</strong></p>

                    <h3>Trail Safety</h3>
                    <p><strong>Before You Hike:</strong></p>
                    <p>Always inform someone of your hiking plans, including your route and expected return time.</p>
                    <p>Check the weather forecast.</p>
                    <p>Ensure your phone is fully charged.</p>
                    <p>Carry a basic first aid kit.</p>
                    <p>Bring a map and compass (and know how to use them).</p>
                    <p>Pack essential items (see Essentials Checklist).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>During Your Hike:</strong></p>
                    <p>Stay on marked trails.</p>
                    <p>Hike with a partner or group when possible.</p>
                    <p>Maintain a sustainable pace.</p>
                    <p>Take regular breaks.</p>
                    <p>Be especially careful on steep or slippery sections.</p>
                    <p>Watch for trail markers and be aware of your location.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>If You Get Lost:</strong></p>
                    <p>Stop and stay calm.</p>
                    <p>Use the S.T.O.P. principle: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan.</p>
                    <p>If you have phone signal, call for help.</p>
                    <p>If no signal, use a whistle (three short blasts is the international distress signal).</p>
                    <p>If it's getting dark, find shelter and wait for daylight.</p>
                    <p>Conserve water and food.</p>

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Queens River Adventure Camp is nestled in the heart of the Nelshoogte State Forest in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Established in 2010 by the Visser family, our camp has grown from a small hiking stopover to a beloved destination for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers.</p>
                
                <p>Named after the Queen Rose Hiking Trail that winds through our property, our camp offers a unique blend of wilderness experience and comfortable accommodation. The trail itself was named after the rare Queen Rose protea that blooms in the surrounding mountains.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>At Queens River Adventure Camp, we are committed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing a safe and memorable hiking experience in one of South Africa's most beautiful landscapes</li>
                    <li>Preserving and protecting the natural environment through sustainable practices</li>
                    <li>Educating visitors about local flora, fauna, and conservation efforts</li>
                    <li>Supporting the local community through employment and partnerships</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Environment</h3>
                <p>The camp is situated in a biodiversity hotspot, home to numerous plant species found nowhere else in the world. The surrounding forest is part of the greater Barberton Mountainland, recognized for its geological significance and ancient rock formations dating back 3.5 billion years.</p>
                
                <p>The area is characterized by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indigenous forests with yellowwood and stinkwood trees</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The last 8km is on a gravel road. While generally well-maintained, a vehicle with good ground clearance is recommended, especially during the rainy season (November to March).</li>
                    <li>Mobile phone reception is limited in the forest area. Download these directions or save them offline before your journey.</li>
                    <li>We recommend arriving during daylight hours as the forest roads can be challenging to navigate after dark.</li>
                    <li>Fuel up at Barberton or Badplaas as there are no fuel stations near the camp.</li>
                    <li>In case you get lost, call the camp at +27 64 880 2175 (when in mobile reception areas).</li>
                </ul>
